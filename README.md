App Analytics & Monetization Dashboard
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes mobile app performance data (10k+ installs) to uncover insights into user growth, engagement, crashes, churn, and monetization.
The analysis combines Python (EDA, data cleaning, visualization) and Power BI dashboards to provide actionable insights for improving user retention and revenue.

🎯 Objectives

Clean and preprocess multiple app-related datasets (AdMob, DAU, new users, ratings, crashes, user loss).

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key usage and monetization patterns.

Build interactive Power BI dashboards for stakeholders.

Publish dashboards to Power BI Service for real-time accessibility.
