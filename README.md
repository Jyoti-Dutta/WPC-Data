📱 App Analytics & Monetization Dashboard
📌 Objective

To analyze mobile app performance data (10k+ installs) and uncover insights into user growth, engagement, crashes, churn, and monetization.
This project combines Python (EDA, data cleaning, visualization) and Power BI dashboards to deliver actionable insights that improve user retention and revenue.

🎯 Key Goals

✅ Clean and preprocess multiple app-related datasets (AdMob, DAU, new users, ratings, crashes, user loss).

✅ Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key usage and monetization patterns.

✅ Build interactive Power BI dashboards for stakeholders.

✅ Publish dashboards to Power BI Service for real-time accessibility.
